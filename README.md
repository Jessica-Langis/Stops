 ## Real Time Bus Tracker
### How to run: 
  Click on the button titled 'Cycle through bus stops'. The marker will move down the street, stopping at each bus stop available for use.
### Future Improvements: 
  1. Update the map location to display a local map
  2. Update the pin color
### License Information: 
  The idea for this project and codebase belongs to MIT. I have simply altered the design and code to suit my own style, incorporating my own code where necessary.
